## Feature Overview

The Dataset Publishing Platform provides a comprehensive set of features for uploading, processing, and publishing datasets with AI-powered metadata generation. The platform is designed to streamline the dataset publishing process, from initial upload to final publication, with a focus on data quality, metadata accuracy, and workflow efficiency.

### Dataset Upload and Processing

The dataset upload and processing feature allows users to upload CSV and Excel files, validate their contents, and extract metadata such as row count, column names, and file size. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for uploading files, with drag-and-drop functionality and progress indicators. The uploaded files are processed to extract metadata and validate their contents, with error messages for invalid files.

### AI-Powered Metadata Generation

The AI-powered metadata generation feature uses artificial intelligence to generate metadata for datasets, including title, description, tags, and category suggestions. The platform integrates with AI services such as OpenAI to analyze dataset contents and generate relevant metadata. The generated metadata is presented to the user for review and editing, with the ability to save drafts and make changes before final publication.

### Publishing Workflow and Review System

The publishing workflow and review system feature provides a structured process for dataset publication, with multiple steps from initial upload to final publication. The platform includes a supervisor review interface for approving or requesting changes to datasets, with version history tracking for dataset changes. The workflow is designed to ensure data quality and metadata accuracy before publication.
