## Architecture Principles

The architecture of the Dataset Publishing Platform follows these key principles:

1. **Modularity**: The system is divided into modular components that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between UI components, business logic, and data access.

3. **API-First Design**: All functionality is exposed through well-defined APIs, enabling future extensions and integrations.

4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, with enhanced features for modern browsers.

5. **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

6. **Accessibility**: The application follows WCAG guidelines for accessibility.

7. **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and data validation are implemented at all levels.

8. **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading and response times, with efficient data fetching and caching.

9. **Scalability**: Designed to handle increasing numbers of users and datasets.

10. **Maintainability**: Clean code, comprehensive documentation, and automated testing for long-term maintainability.

## Folder Structure

The application follows a structured organization of files and directories:

```
/
├── docs/                  # Documentation

```

## Request Flow

1. **Client Request**: User interacts with the UI, triggering a request.
2. **Next.js Routing**: Next.js routes the request to the appropriate page or API route.
3. **API Handler**: For API requests, the API handler processes the request.
4. **Service Layer**: Business logic is executed in the service layer.
5. **Data Access**: Data is retrieved from or written to the database.
6. **Response**: The response is sent back to the client.
7. **Client Rendering**: The UI is updated based on the response.

## Error Handling

The application implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

1. **Client-Side Validation**: Form inputs are validated on the client side before submission.
2. **API Validation**: API requests are validated on the server side.
3. **Error Responses**: API errors are returned with appropriate status codes and error messages.
4. **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries catch and handle rendering errors.
5. **Logging**: Errors are logged for monitoring and debugging.
6. **User Feedback**: User-friendly error messages are displayed to the user.

For more details, see the [Error Handling](./error-handling.md) documentation.

## Security Considerations

The application implements various security measures:

1. **Authentication**: User authentication using NextAuth.js.
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different user types.
3. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized.
4. **CSRF Protection**: Protection against cross-site request forgery attacks.
5. **XSS Prevention**: Prevention of cross-site scripting attacks.
6. **Secure Headers**: HTTP security headers for additional protection.
7. **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse.
8. **File Validation**: Validation of uploaded files to prevent malicious uploads.

For more details, see the [Authentication and Authorization](./auth.md) documentation.

## Internationalization

The application supports multiple languages and locales:

1. **Bilingual Support**: Full support for English and Arabic.
2. **RTL Layout**: Right-to-left layout support for Arabic.
3. **Translation Management**: Structured translation files and keys.
4. **Date and Number Formatting**: Locale-aware formatting of dates and numbers.
5. **Metadata Bilingual Support**: Bilingual metadata for datasets.

For more details, see the [Internationalization](./internationalization.md) documentation.
